# telescope.nvim

Gaze deeply into unknown regions using the power of the moon.

## Goals


pipeline different objects

"finder"
    - executable: rg, git ls-files, ...
    - things in lua already
    - vim things

"picker"
    - fzf
    - sk
    - does this always need to be fuzzy?

    - you'll map what you want to do with vimscript / lua mappings

"previewer"
    - sometimes built-in
    - sometimes a lua callback



fzf:
- have a list of inputs
- i have a prompt/things people typed
- instantly return the stuff via stdout
